# Concepts React

## Immutability

### What is immutabilit in React?

Immutability is a concept that once an object is created, it cannot be modified. In React, state is immutable. You cannot modify the state directly, but you can assign a new state to the variable holding the state.

### Why is immutability important?

Immutability makes the state management predictable. When you change the state, you can be sure that the state is not modified somewhere else. This makes the state management easier to understand and debug.

### How to implement immutability in React?

In React, you can implement immutability by using the `setState()` method. The `setState()` method takes an object as an argument and merges it with the current state. It returns a new state object.

```js
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
```

### What is the difference between mutable and immutable objects?

A mutable object can be modified after it is created. An immutable object cannot be modified after it is created.

## Closure

### What is closure in JavaScript?

A closure is a function that has access to the outer function’s variables in addition to its own variables and global variables. The closure has access to the outer function’s scope chain even after the outer function returns.

### What is the use of closure in JavaScript?

Closures are useful because they let you associate data with a function that operates on that data. This has obvious parallels to object-oriented programming, where objects allow you to associate data (object state) with one or more methods.

### How you can fix closure related issue in React?

You can fix closure related issue in React by using `useRef()` hook. The `useRef()` hook returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument (`initialValue`). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.

Another way to fix closure related issue in React is to use `useCallback()` hook. The `useCallback()` hook returns a memoized callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. It is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.

Another way to fix closure related issue in React is to use `useMemo()` hook. The `useMemo()` hook returns a memoized value. It is useful when you need to compute a value that is expensive to compute and you want to avoid re-computing it on every render.

Another way to fix closure related issue in React is to use `useReducer()` hook. The `useReducer()` hook returns a stateful value, and a dispatch function to update the state. It is useful when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

Everytime you need to update an information from a variable that depends on their updated state, you should use a function that returns the updated state.

```js
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
